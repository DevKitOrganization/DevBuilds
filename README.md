# DevBuilds

DevBuilds contains ready-to-use scripts for building, testing, and releasing apps and packages using
Apple’s Xcode tools. The scripts are intended to provide projects with a simple way to run CI tasks
on remote systems like GitHub Actions. Importantly, there’s no need to install Ruby or some other 
third-party runtime.
